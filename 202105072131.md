title: "The ultimate object of design is form"

"The reason that iron filings placed in a magnetic field exhibit a pattern -or have form, as we say- is that the field they are in is not homogeneous. If the world were totally regular and homogeneous, there would be no forces, and no forms. Everything would be amorphous. But an irregular world tries to compensate for its own irregularities by fitting itself to them, and thereby takes on form."
