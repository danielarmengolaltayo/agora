title: "The forms produced in the unselfconscious system do not depend on the inventiveness of the individual, but only on the individual's place within the process"

"The source of this trouble lies with the individual. In the unselfconscious system the individual is no more than an agent. He does what he knows how to do as best he can. Very little demand is made of him. He need not himself be able to invent forms at all. All that is required is that he should recognize misfits and respond to them by making minor changes. It is not even necessary that these changes be for the better. As we have seen, the system, being selfÂ­adjusting, finds its own equilibrium - provided only that misfit incites some reaction in the craftsman. The forms produced in such a system are not the work of individuals, and their success does not depend on any one man's artistry, but only on the artist's place within the process."
