# PART ONE 
## 2 / goodness of fit
- [[202105072131]] The ultimate object of design is form
- [[202105072132]] The recognition of patterns is the first step in the process of design 
- [[202105072133]] The form is the solution to the problem; the context defines the problem
- [[202105072134]] We have control over the form, not over the context 
- [[202105072135]] The design process is about achieving fitness between the form and its context 
- [[202105072136]] On the importance of holding multiple perspectives over the same reality
- [[202105072137]] The context cannot be adequately described
- [[202105072141]] Context and form are complementary
- [[202105072142]] We see fitness through the perspective of misfits
- [[202105072143]] Good fit and misfit are not the same
- [[202105072144]] Misfits help us to pick a finite set of requirements from the infinite set of possible ones
- [[202105072145]] Fit as the absence of misfits
- [[202105072146]] To describe fit and misfit between form and context, we must make a list of binary variables

## 3+4+5?
- [[202105072147]] Simple cultures can teach us how to solve the problem of complexity
- [[202105072303]] Definition of unselfconscious vs selfconscious cultures
    
# WIP
## 4 / the unselfconscious process   
- "In the unselfconscious culture a clear pattern has emerged. Being self-adjusting, its action allows the production of wellÂ­fitting forms to persist in active equilibrium with the system."
## 5 / the selfconscious process 
- the form-maker's assertion of his individuality
