"No complex adaptive system will succeed in adapting in a reasonable amount of time unless the adaptation can proceed subsystem by subsystem, each subsystem relatively independent of the others."

"We may therefore picture the process of form-making as the action of a series of subsystems, all interlinked, yet suf­ficiently free of one another to adjust independently in a feasible amount of time. It works, because the cycles of cor­rection and recorrection, which occur during adaptation, are restricted to one subsystem at a time"
