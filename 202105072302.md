title: "The process of adaptation to the changes that occur in the system"
---
- [[202105072252]] No complex adaptive system will succeed in adapting in a reasonable amount of time unless the adaptation can proceed subsystem by subsystem (modularity)
- [[202105072253]] Form足builders in unselfconscious cultures respond to small changes in a way that allows the subsystems of the misfit system to work independently (self-organizing)
- [[202105072251]] Rigid tradition and immediate action make the unselfconscious process self足adjusting
- [[202105072257]] Unselfconscious cultures fail when faced with the complex unfamiliar task of actually inventing forms from scratch
- [[202105072258]] In selfconscious cultures the reaction to failure becomes less direct and the firmness of tradition dissolves
