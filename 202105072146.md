title: "To describe fit and misfit between form and context, we must make a list of binary variables"
---
"We decided in the last chapter that to describe fit and misfit between form and context, we must make a list of binary variables, each naming some one potential misfit which may occur."

"We may describe the state of all the variables at once by a row of  1's and O's, one for each variable: for instance, for twenty variables, 001 00110101110110000 would be one state. Each possible row of 1's and O's is a possible state of the ensemble"

"As form-making proceeds, so the system of variables changes state. One misfit is eradicated, another misfit occurs, and these changes in their turn set off reactions within the system that affect the states of other variables. As form and culture change, state follows state. The sequence of states which the system passes through is a record or history of the adaptation beÂ­tween form and context."
