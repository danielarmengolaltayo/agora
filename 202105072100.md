title: "Diagrams are modular"
---
Christopher Alexander describes diagrams as independent and interoperable. 

"you can study them and improve them one at a time, so that their evolution can be gradual and cumulative"

"allow you to create a single whole from them, by fusion"

According to Wikipedia, "modularity is the degree to which a system's components may be separated and recombined".
