title: "Form­builders in unselfconscious cultures respond to small changes in a way that allows the subsystems of the misfit system to work independently (self-organizing)"

"The vital point that underlies the following discussion is that the form­builders in unselfconscious cultures respond to small changes in a way that allows the subsystems of the misfit system to work independently - but that because the selfconscious response to change cannot take place subsystem by subsystem, its forms are arbitrary."

"the unselfconscious process has a structure that makes it homeostatic (self-organizing), and that it therefore  consistently produces well-fitting forms, even in the face of change"
