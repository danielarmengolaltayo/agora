title: "The distinction between unselfconscious and selfconscious cultures is artificial"
---
"I do not wish to imply here that there is any unique process of development that makes selfconscious cultures out  of  unÂ­selfconscious ones. Let us remember anyway that the distinction between the two is artificial. And, besides, the facts of history suggest that the development from one to the other can happen in rather different ways."

"From the point of view of my present argument it is immaterial how the development occurs. All that matters, actually, is that sooner or later the phenomenon of the master craftsman takes control of the form-making activities."
