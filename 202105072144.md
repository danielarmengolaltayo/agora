title: "Misfits help us to pick a finite set of requirements from the infinite set of possible ones"
---
"We do not have a field description of the context, and therefore have no intrinsic way of reducing the potentially infinite set of requirements to finite terms. Yet for practical reasons we do need some way of picking a finite set from the infinite set of possible ones. In the case of requirements, no sensible way of picking this finite set presents itself. From a purely descriptive standpoint we have no way of knowing which of the infinitely many relations between form and context to include, and which ones to leave out."

"But if we think of the requirements from a negative point of view, as potential misfits, there is a simple way of picking a finite set. This is because it is through misfit that the problem originally brings itself to our attention. We take just those relations between form and context which obtrude most strongly, which demand attention most clearly, which seem most likely to go wrong. We cannot do better than this."
