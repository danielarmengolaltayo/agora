- [[202105072213]] Actions are governed by habit
- [[202105072240]] The forms produced in the unselfconscious system do not depend on the inventiveness of the individual, but only on the individual's place within the process
- [[202105072241]] The forms produced in the selfconscious system depend on the constraints in the inventiveness of the individual

- [[202105072246]] The person who makes the form, lives in it, maintains it and adapts it to the changing needs
- [[202105072247]] Failure or inadequacy of the form leads directly to the action
- [[202105072248]] There is a tendency to equilibrium inherent in the organization of the process
- [[202105072250]] Immediate action
- [[202105072251]] Rigid tradition and immediate action make the unselfconscious process selfÂ­adjusting
- [[202105072252]] No complex adaptive system will succeed in adapting in a reasonable amount of time unless the adaptation can proceed subsystem by subsystem (modularity)
- [[202105072253]] FormÂ­builders in unselfconscious cultures respond to small changes in a way that allows the subsystems of the misfit system to work independently (self-organizing)
- [[202105072257]] Unselfconscious cultures fail when faced with the complex unfamiliar task of actually inventing forms from scratch
- [[202105072258]] In selfconscious cultures the reaction to failure becomes less direct and the firmness of tradition dissolves
