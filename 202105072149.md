title: "Unselfconscious cultures learn its form-making informally, through imitation and correction, without general principles or explicit rules"

"In the unselfconscious culture [...] there is a right way to make buildings and a wrong way; but while there may be generally accepted remedies for specific failures, there are no general principles"

"At one extreme we have a kind of teaching that relies on the novice's very gradual exposure to the craft in question, on his ability to imitate by practice, on his response to sanctions, penalties, and reinforcing smiles and frowns. [...] The most important feature of this kind of learning is that the rules are not made explicit, but are, as it were, revealed through the correction of mistakes"
