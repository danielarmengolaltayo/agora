title: "Rigid tradition and immediate action make the unselfconscious process self­adjusting"
---
"On the one hand the directness of the response to misfit ensures that each failure is corrected as soon as it occurs, and thereby restricts the change to one subsystem at a time. And on the other hand the force of tradition, by resisting needless change, holds steady all the variables not in the relevant subsystem, and prevents those minor disturbances outside the subsystem from taking hold. Rigid tradition and immediate action may seem contradictory. But it is the very contrast between these two which makes the process self­adjusting."
