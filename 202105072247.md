title: "Failure or inadequacy of the form leads directly to the action"
---
"This directness is the second crucial feature of the unselfÂ­conscious system's form-production. Failure and correction go side by side. There is no deliberation in between the recognition of a failure and the reaction to it."

"The directness is enhanced, too, by the fact that building and repair are so much an everyday affair"

"Impermanent materials and unsettled ways of life demand constant reconstruction and repair, with the result that the shaping of form is a task perpetually before the dweller's eyes and hand. If a form is made the same way several times over, or even simply left unchanged, we can be fairly sure that its inhabitant finds little wrong with it. Since its materials are close to hand, and their use his own responsibility, he will not hesitate to act if there are any minor changes which seem worth making"
