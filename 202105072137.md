"In general, unfortunately, we cannot give an adequate description of the context we are dealing with"

"The experiment of putting a prototype form in the context itself is the real criterion of fit. A complete unitary description of the demands made by the context is the only fully adequate nonexperimental criterion. The first is too expensive, the second is impossible: so what shall we do?"
